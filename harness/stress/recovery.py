"""Did the driver come back? Judged from the pump's side only, so it needs nothing from the app.

After a round's faults are undone (Chaos.quiesce), a healthy TandemKit reconnects on its own, re-authenticates, and
answers a qualifying event with the request its suggested handler names. Each step is checked against faketandem's
snapshot and request log:

  1. session: the emulator reports a connected, authenticated central
  2. probe:   a `remainingInsulin` event (read-only: its handler is InsulinStatusRequest) gets that request back

A link that is up with no working session (TandemKit 7e58aac: a disconnect failed the connect that followed it, and
the driver held a socket nobody authenticated on until its connect timeout) fails step 1 or 2; a wedged command
queue fails step 2.
